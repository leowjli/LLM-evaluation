Welcome to a LLM Evaluation Platform, a full stack web app that asks users to input prompts where they can subsequently view responses from multiple LLMs side-by-side.
The application also shows metrics such as accuracy, relevancy, and response time for each LLM and an analytics dashboard for visualizing performance metrics for different prompts and LLMs
